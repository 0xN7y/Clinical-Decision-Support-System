### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-powered Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to assist healthcare professionals in making accurate, evidence-based medical decisions. By integrating structured electronic health records (EHRs) and unstructured medical literature (e.g. MIMIC-III), this system enhances clinical decision-making, reduces misdiagnoses, and improves patient outcomes.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals and Objectives

âœ… Retrieve relevant medical information from structured EHRs and unstructured text sources.

âœ… Generate reliable, context-aware clinical recommendations based on up-to-date medical knowledge.

âœ… Reduce misdiagnoses and improve treatment accuracy.

âœ… Enhance medical education and training by providing real-time AI-driven insights.
